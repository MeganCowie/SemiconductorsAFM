Check units for Efield and Charge
Check units for force
Check "static force" terminology


Convert force to frequency shift and dissipation
In phase and out of phase force contributions
1w and 2w frequency shift and dissipation contributions

Would be nice:
- zsem set rather than variable, solve instead for psi
