Figure out a better numerical solution method
(Currently have runtime warnings from SurfacepotForce fsolve.)
(Might be able to get rid of it by rewriting Vs equation to get rid of large #s)

Figure out dissipation...
I think Freqshift looks okay but check.

Look at 1w and 2w force components

Check units for Efield and Charge
Check "static force" terminology

Check units for bulk - shouldn't need the division in CallbacksBulk

Figure out why p-type doping is so unreliable.
