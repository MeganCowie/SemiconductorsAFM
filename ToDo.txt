Figure out a better numerical solution method
(Currently have runtime warnings from SurfacepotForce fsolve.)
(Might be able to get rid of it by rewriting Vs equation to get rid of large #s)

Look at 1w and 2w force components

Check units for Efield and Charge
Check "static force" terminology

Check units for bulk - shouldn't need the division in CallbacksBulk

n-type to p-type is a mess: I need a toggle like the bulk situation which forces 
one or the other to zero. Or to check my equations because blech.


Dissipation and freqshift prefactors are wrong.

Rephrase "hop" units. 

Do some heavy duty commenting.
