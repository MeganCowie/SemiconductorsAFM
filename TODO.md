# To Do

Add save buttons everywhere.
Or at least organize saving better.

I should be able to link the saving protocol to recalling existing data. But... that seems tedious and since I've sped up some of the calculations it's not such a strong requirement anymore.

Fix appearance.
Change pixels to 'em', or some better way to improve accessibility across different monitors.

A couple of extra toggles around to remove or do something with.

Time traces stuff is not done yet.
Optics stuff is not done yet.

Semiconductors: Surface polarization and depletion width.

I'm not 100% sure how I should be including the CPD in the band diagram. I think that as it is right now, what's shown as Vins is actually Vins+CPD.
