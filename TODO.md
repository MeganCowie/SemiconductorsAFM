# To Do

Array organization is disgusting. And organize function input parameters better.

Add save buttons everywhere.
Or at least organize saving better.

I should be able to link the saving protocol to recalling existing data. But... that seems tedious and since I've sped up some of the calculations it's not such a strong requirement anymore.

But I should probably put all of the variables in a dictionary or something. It is becoming quite the mess...


Fix appearance.
Change pixels to 'em', or some better way to improve accessibility across different monitors.
