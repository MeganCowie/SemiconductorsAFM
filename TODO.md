# To Do

Check units for Efield and Charge

converting between n-type to p-type is a mess: I need a toggle like the bulk
situation which forces one or the other to zero.

Add save buttons everywhere.
Or at least organize saving better.

Rephrase "hop" units and the RTN stuff is almost outdated.

Change pixels to 'em', or some better way to improve accessibility across
different monitors.
Fix appearance

Calculate fm-AFM oscillations in parallel.


Add toggles for n-type and p-type
Add toggles for existing analyses parameters
